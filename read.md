Hi, 

Bhakti and Iris are MPS Communication Design student (2025) at Parsons School of Design. 

Bhakti and Iris collaborated for their Typography & Interaction class (2024-2025) project - Spread. The project is based on the article â€œPolitics of Design by Ruben Patar, published in 2016.

Together, they focused on exploring the relationship between typography and interaction with creating HTML and CSS to structure and style the webpage. The goal was to make make a responsive layout. 

Thank you!
